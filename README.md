# alarm

Raspberry Pi 3 alarm clock using python3 script and crontab requires HiFiBerry AMP2 and 1 or 2 external speakers

I am creating a Radio Alarm Clock, which has many features. One feature is the ability to play music when an alarm goes off. I wasn't quite sure of the best way to implement an alarm clock. And while I have used an alarm clock, I wasn't quite sure what features would be required. So, I created this script and played with it for a while to ensure it had everything I needed.

I have completed other scripts in this series:
* songPlayer, which plays music from my music library
* streamPlayer, which plays internet radio stations
* fmPlayer, which plays over-the-air FM radio stations

Eventually the featues of these scripts will be folded into the Alarm Clock Radio's GUI.
