# alarm

Raspberry Pi 3 alarm clock using python3 script

I am creating a Radio Alarm Clock, which has many features. One feature is the ability to play music when an alarm goes off. I wasn't quite sure of the best way to implement an alarm clock and of the features required. So, I created this script and played with it for a while to ensure it had everything I needed.

Eventually the featues of this script will be folded into the Alarm Clock Radio's GUI.
